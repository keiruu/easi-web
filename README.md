# EASI Web
### This is a web implementation of our undergraduate thesis paper entitled Easi: A text simplification mobile app using Natural Language Processing.
### Easi is a text simplification application developed using OpenAIâ€™s newest language model GPT-3. It first started out as a mobile application developed specifically for elementary students and has now been ported on the web for everyone to use. 
### Easi itself was made by Information Technology students from West Visayas State University - Main Campus as part of their Undergraduate Thesis.
